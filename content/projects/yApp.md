**A Simple Social Network**

yApp is a simple social network with some nice blogging features. It is built with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and combines traditional blogging with social interactions. Users can create content, follow other writers, and engage with posts through comments and reactions. It is my first full stack project and has a very minimalistic frontend.

**Built with:**
- Frontend: Angular
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Status: In Progress

**Some features:**
- User authentication and profiles
- User pages with blog posts
- Social interactions like follows and comments
